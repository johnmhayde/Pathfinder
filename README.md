# Pathfinder

This is an A* implementation written to help with a pathfinding program. I chose not to implement the f = g + h cost, and only focused on the heuristic because that fit my needs for what the program was being used for.  

## Running the Program
Make sure the package directory is setup properly. Then, run the program through these commands:
```
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp
./a.out
```
