# Pathfinder

This is an A* implementation written to help with a pathfinding program. I chose not to implement the f = g + h cost, and only focused on the heuristic because that fit the specified needs of speed and functionality.

## Running the Program
Make sure you are in the proper directory containing the program files. Then, run the program through these commands:
```
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp
./a.out
```
